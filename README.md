# DOT-RUNNER

SWE_150 Project.

It is all about making a simple game using c++ ..Initially I had made a snake box where the total interface will be shown..Its just a basic code using   #####
                   #####
                   
                   #   #
                   #   #
                   #   #
                   ##### 
this pattern ..this code will be shown in snake.cpp
.Then I made Head with the letter (o) and Food (F);
third step using switch statement I will control the move ment of the Dot runner.In that case,a=LEFT; d=RIGHT, s=DOWN,w=UP
and the 4th step is scoring point ..if one can pass the food.

## Installation

Install codeblocks.For this you have to run this [Dot Runner Final Code](https://github.com/samuxoa/DotRunner/blob/main/Code/snake04.cpp) on [Code Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/).

Then you have to simply follow the running test methods.For control that dot runner ,u have to use move left,right,upward or downward using this key a,d,w and s.


That is all !!!!!!!!!
